# CachyOS/Linux Tweaks

## Q: What is this?
A: This is an assortment of self-made settings and tweaks on top of the base CachyOS install I use personally on my system.

## Q: Who is this for?
A: Myself, and anyone else who finds anything in here useful, see assumptions.txt.

## Q: How do I make use of this?
A: Make the relevant changes by following instructions.sh within each category and following the file structure. If the directory doesn't exist, make it. In case of configs, be sure to open the terminal within the directory of the instructions.sh file you're following.

Whenever it mentions rebooting, this doesn't mean you have to do so every single time for every single tiny thing you change, no, if a reboot is ever explicitly needed after some tweak, the instructions will outline so.
