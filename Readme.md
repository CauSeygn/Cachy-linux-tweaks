# CachyOS/Linux Tweaks

## Q: What is this?
A: This is an assortment of self-made settings and tweaks on top of the base CachyOS install I use personally on my system.

## Q: Who is this for?
A: Myself, and anyone else who finds anything in here useful, see [categories/assumptions.txt](./categories/assumptions.txt).

## Q: How do I make use of this?
A: Make the relevant changes by following `instructions.md` within each category and following the file structure. If the directory doesn't exist, make it. In case of configs, be sure to open the terminal within the directory of the `instructions.md` file you're following. (you will be reminded with a __open terminal here__ within each `instructions.md` file that handles copying configs)

Whenever it mentions rebooting, this doesn't mean you have to do so every single time for every single tiny thing you change, no, if a reboot is ever explicitly needed after some tweak, the instructions will outline so.
