# Tweak /etc/locale.gen, by uncommenting any locales you want to add,
# comments are denoted by '#' so simply delete any infront of the locales
# you want, example (will open the file in kate):

kate /etc/locale.gen

# If you play visual novels, you want to uncomment the ja_JP.UTF-8
# locale, otherwise characters won't render properly or the game won't
# even run. Afterwards, run:

sudo locale-gen

# This will regenerate locales on the system.
