# These are my fish shell binds and prompt, to use them
# simply copy them to their expected location.

# If you use Konsole, the Shift+Right, Shift+Left binds likely won't work.
# Either rebind them, or open Konsole, unbind these hotkeys in it, and
# open the profile editor:
# Settings -> Profiles (you have to make a new one) -> Edit profile.
# Navigate to the keyboard tab, then go edit the Default (XFree 4) keyboard.
# Click on add, and add two bindings (Pay attention to the order):

# on the left:
Left+Shift-Ctrl-Alt-AppScreen
Right+Shift-Ctrl-Alt-AppScreen

# on the right:
\E[1;*D
\E[1;*C

# then save the bind list, now Shift+Left and Shift+Right will work
# once you re-enter Konsole.
