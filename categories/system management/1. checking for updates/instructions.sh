# Pacman is different to other package managers such as apt, performing
# checks to the database directly is unsafe if you don't plan on also
# updating your system. This equates to running either paru or pacman
# with the '-Sy' flags. This by itself isn't dangerous if you update
# later without installing anything else in the meantime, but if you forget,
# you're running the risk of leaving your system in a destabilized state.

# To safely check for updates you have two things, the first is:

checkupdates

# The second is the cachy-updates system tray
# (right click -> Check for updates) or view what is already there
# as it runs periodically by itself.

# The first one scans only pacman, the second one scans everything.
