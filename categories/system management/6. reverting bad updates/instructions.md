# Preface
If you get a bad update (system won't boot into the OS, shit's broken,...), you can simply restore a previously working snapshot.

## Reverting
Boot into a snapshot of your choice, and you'll be greeted with a limine notification, telling you you're in one, simply restore from the notification, or open `limine-snapper-restore` from the app menu and restore from there.

### __DO NOT USE `BTRFS-ASSISTANT`, IT CANNOT RESTORE DIFFERENT KERNELS, YOU'LL BE LEFT IN A BROKEN STATE.__
