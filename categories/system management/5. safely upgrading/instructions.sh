# If you've heard that 'Linux doesn't need to restart after updates'
# then forget that, yes it does. When programs update, their services
# need to be restarted manually otherwise they won't use the new version
# (restart does this automatically naturally), and when the kernel itself
# updates a full restart is needed to unload the old one.

# Anyway, to safely update your system, run:

paru

# 'paru' by itself is the same running 'sudo pacman -Syu'.
# Alternatively run cachy-update from the systray (either by left clicking
# it or right click -> run cachy-update). This will update every package on
# your system and the AUR (additionally cachy-update updates anything else
# you might have, such as flatpaks).

# If you want to cancel an update, it is safe to do so ONLY if it hasn't
# already started (example: it's downloading things), or if you just
# finished updating system packages and are proceeding to the AUR portion.
# Never cancel an ongoing update otherwise you might restart to a broken system.
# Likewise if you cancel out of an upgrade DO NOT install (using paru -S)
# anything because your database is now out of sync, this is the same as
# doing paru -Sy package which you should never do. paru -Syu package is
# safe, but generally avoid this.

# After an upgrade if you see the kernel being rebuilt, it's time to
# restart, especially if on nvidia side of things you see the driver
# getting upgraded (usually it will notify you either way but sometimes not).
